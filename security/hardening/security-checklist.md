2. Encryption in transit (TLS)
3. Secrets management
4. Basic firewall rules
5. Security headers

### ⚠️ High Priority (Implement Soon)
1. Encryption at rest
2. Network segmentation
3. Comprehensive monitoring
4. Input validation
5. Container security

### 📋 Medium Priority (Plan for Implementation)
1. Advanced monitoring and alerting
2. Compliance frameworks
3. Incident response procedures
4. Regular security assessments
5. Employee training programs

## 🎯 Security Metrics

Track these metrics to measure security posture:
