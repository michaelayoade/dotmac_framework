# 🚀 DotMac Platform - ISP Management System

**Status**: Beta Release - Active Development

> The DotMac Platform is currently in active development with core revenue and billing systems operational. For deployment guidance and current capabilities, see the [Production Readiness Checklist](PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md).

## 🎯 Project Vision

DotMac is being developed as a comprehensive ISP management platform with two main components:

1. **ISP Framework**: Monolithic ISP operations management system
2. **Management Platform**: Multi-tenant SaaS orchestration platform

**Target Market**: ISPs with 50-10,000 customers (rural WISPs to regional providers)

## 📊 Development Status Overview

**Development Phases:**

- ✅ **Revenue Protection**: Billing calculations, payment processing, financial accuracy
- ✅ **Platform Stability**: Core infrastructure, security, monitoring
- ✅ **Platform Extensibility**: Plugin system, API framework, SDK architecture
- 🚧 **Production Operations**: Deployment automation, scaling, monitoring, backup/recovery

**Current Capabilities**: Suitable for development environments and revenue system testing
**Production Deployment**: Additional operational infrastructure required

## 🚀 Development Quick Start

**Choose your development path:**

### Option 1: Full Development Environment
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dotmac-framework

# Complete setup (all components)
make install-dev
make dev
```

### Option 2: Backend Only (API Development)
```bash
make dev-backend
# Starts ISP Framework + Management Platform APIs only
```

### Option 3: Frontend Only (Portal Development)
```bash
make dev-frontend  
# Starts all portals with mock backend data
```

### Option 4: Platform-Specific Development
```bash
# ISP Framework only
cd isp-framework && make run-dev

# Management Platform only  
cd management-platform && make run-api
```

## 📋 What's Working (Safe to Use)

### ✅ Revenue-Critical Components (Production-Ready)
- **Billing Engine**: Accurate calculations, payment processing
- **Financial Reporting**: Invoice generation, payment tracking
- **Customer Management**: CRUD operations, service assignments
- **Service Provisioning**: Basic service lifecycle management
- **Portal Authentication**: Multi-portal access system

### ✅ Core Development Infrastructure
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with OpenAPI documentation
- **Authentication**: JWT + Portal-based auth systems
- **Testing Framework**: AI-first testing with property-based tests
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive error handling, logging
- **Observability**: SignOz integration for monitoring

## 🚧 Production Operations Requirements

**Infrastructure Automation:**
- Deployment automation and orchestration
- Auto-scaling and load balancing
- Automated backup and recovery procedures
- SSL certificate management
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Production security hardening

**Platform Enhancements:**
- Container-per-tenant isolation (designed, implementation in progress)
- Multi-region deployment capabilities
- Advanced analytics and business intelligence
- Native mobile applications
- Extended third-party integration library

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a development project. Key areas needing contribution:

1. **Production Operations** - Deployment automation, scaling, monitoring
2. **Testing Coverage** - Expand AI-first testing to more modules  
3. **Documentation** - User guides, deployment procedures
4. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end workflow validation
5. **Performance Optimization** - Scale testing, caching strategies

## ⚡ Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- PostgreSQL 15+ with SQLAlchemy
- Redis 7+ for caching and sessions
- Celery for background tasks

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Next.js 14
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- pnpm workspaces for monorepo management

**Infrastructure:**

- SignOz for observability and monitoring
- OpenBao/Vault for secrets management
- Nginx for reverse proxy (production)

## 🚨 Important Warnings

### For Developers
- ✅ **Safe**: Revenue calculations, billing logic, core APIs
- ✅ **Safe**: Development environment, testing, code quality tools
- ⚠️ **Caution**: Database migrations (backup data first)
- ❌ **Not Ready**: Production deployment, auto-scaling, multi-tenancy

### For Business Use
- ✅ **Revenue Testing**: Billing calculations are production-accurate
- ✅ **Demo Environment**: Suitable for client demonstrations
- ❌ **Customer Deployment**: Not ready for live customer operations
- ❌ **Production SaaS**: Multi-tenant functionality incomplete
