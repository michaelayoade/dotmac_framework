# 🚀 DotMac Platform - SaaS for Internet Service Providers

**Status**: Beta Release - Active Development

> DotMac is a **SaaS platform** where ISPs get dedicated, secure containers with complete operational management. We handle infrastructure, ISPs focus on customers. For deployment status, see the [Production Readiness Checklist](PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md).

## 🎯 Platform Vision

**DotMac provides ISPs with dedicated containerized instances** for complete operational management through our SaaS platform:

- **Container-per-Tenant**: Each ISP gets an isolated, dedicated container
- **Usage-Based Pricing**: Pay per customer + optional premium bundles  
- **Partner Revenue Sharing**: 10-20% commissions for vendor/reseller partners
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: We handle servers, ISPs handle customers

**Target Market**: ISPs with 50-10,000 customers (rural WISPs to regional providers)

## 📊 Development Status Overview

**Development Phases:**

- ✅ **Revenue Protection**: Billing calculations, payment processing, financial accuracy
- ✅ **Platform Stability**: Core infrastructure, security, monitoring
- ✅ **Platform Extensibility**: Plugin system, API framework, SDK architecture
- 🚧 **Production Operations**: Deployment automation, scaling, monitoring, backup/recovery

**Current Capabilities**: Suitable for development environments and revenue system testing
**Production Deployment**: Additional operational infrastructure required

## 🚀 SaaS Platform Development

**Developing the DotMac SaaS Platform:**

### Option 1: Full SaaS Platform Development
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dotmac-framework

# Complete SaaS platform setup
make install-dev
make dev
# Simulates: Management Platform + Multiple ISP Containers
```

### Option 2: Container Development (ISP Framework)
```bash
make dev-backend
# Develops individual ISP container functionality
```

### Option 3: Platform Development (SaaS Orchestration)
```bash
make dev-frontend  
# Develops container provisioning and partner portals
```

### Option 4: Component-Specific Development
```bash
# ISP Container Framework (tenant-specific)
cd isp-framework && make run-dev

# SaaS Management Platform (we operate)
cd management-platform && make run-api
```

## 🚨 Important Warnings

### For Developers
- ✅ **Safe**: Revenue calculations, billing logic, core APIs
- ✅ **Safe**: Development environment, testing, code quality tools
- ⚠️ **Caution**: Database migrations (backup data first)
- ❌ **Not Ready**: Production deployment, auto-scaling, multi-tenancy

### For Business Use
- ✅ **Revenue Testing**: Usage-based billing calculations are production-accurate
- ✅ **Demo Environment**: Suitable for ISP prospect demonstrations
- ✅ **Partner Demos**: Shows container-per-tenant isolation model
- ❌ **Live SaaS Operations**: Container provisioning automation incomplete
- ❌ **Partner Commissions**: Revenue sharing calculations need production testing
