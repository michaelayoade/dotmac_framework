"""
DotMac Events - Transport-agnostic event bus package.

This package provides a unified interface for publishing and consuming events
across different message brokers and transports.

Example usage:

    from dotmac.communications.events import Event, create_memory_bus, ConsumerOptions, run_consumer

    # Create an event bus
    bus = create_memory_bus()

    # Publish an event
    event = Event(topic="user.created", payload={"user_id": 123, "name": "John"})
    await bus.publish(event)

    # Subscribe to events
    async def handle_user_created(event):
        print(f"User created: {event.payload}")

    options = ConsumerOptions(max_retries=3)
    await run_consumer(bus, "user.created", handle_user_created, options)

For production use with Redis:

    from dotmac.communications.events import create_redis_bus, RedisConfig

    # Redis Streams
    redis_config = RedisConfig(host="localhost", port=6379)
    bus = create_redis_bus(redis_config)

    # Kafka support has been removed from this package.
