All notable changes to the DotMac Communications package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-04

### Added
- **Unified Communications Package**: Aggregated three separate packages into one
  - `dotmac-notifications` → `dotmac.communications.notifications`
  - `dotmac-websockets` → `dotmac.communications.websockets` 
  - `dotmac-events` → `dotmac.communications.events`

- **Comprehensive Communication System**:
  - Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push notifications, webhooks)
  - Real-time WebSocket communication with channel management
  - Event-driven messaging with multiple backends (memory, Redis)
  - Template-based messaging with Jinja2 support
  - Authentication and authorization for WebSockets
  - Dead letter queue handling for events
  - Delivery tracking and retry mechanisms

- **Unified Service Interface**:
  - `CommunicationsService` class providing access to all components
  - Factory functions for easy service creation
  - Configurable architecture with sensible defaults
  - Graceful degradation when components are unavailable

- **Production Features**:
  - Comprehensive test suite with 100+ test cases
  - Type hints throughout the codebase
  - Async/await support where applicable
  - Error handling and logging integration
  - Performance optimizations and connection pooling

- **Developer Experience**:
  - Complete API documentation
  - Migration guide from separate packages
  - Example usage patterns
  - Configuration validation
  - Observability hooks and metrics

### Technical Details
- **Dependencies**: Compatible with Python 3.9+
- **Backends**: Memory, Redis, with extensible adapter pattern
- **Protocols**: WebSocket, HTTP, with FastAPI integration
- **Serialization**: JSON with pluggable codec system
- **Authentication**: JWT, session-based, with middleware support

### Migration Notes
- All imports from `dotmac.notifications`, `dotmac.websockets`, and `dotmac.events` should be updated to use the new `dotmac.communications.*` paths
- Configuration structure has been unified but remains backwards compatible
- Factory functions provide simplified setup for common use cases
- See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for detailed migration instructions

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is the initial release of the unified package
- Old separate packages are deprecated but imports have been updated automatically

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced memory footprint by eliminating duplicate dependencies
- Shared connection pools across communication types
- Optimized event processing with batch operations
- WebSocket connection multiplexing

### Security Enhancements
- Unified authentication across all communication channels
- Rate limiting and throttling for all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure WebSocket connections with proper CORS handling
