"""
Use Cases Layer
Application business logic orchestration

This layer contains the application-specific business rules and orchestrates 
the interaction between different services and infrastructure components.
It represents the use cases of the application and encapsulates the workflow
logic that drives the business processes.

Key Responsibilities:
- Orchestrate complex business workflows
- Coordinate between multiple services and domains
- Handle application-level business rules
- Manage transaction boundaries
- Implement business process flows

Use cases should be:
- Independent of external concerns (UI, database, framework)
- Focused on a single business capability
- Composable and reusable
- Testable in isolation
