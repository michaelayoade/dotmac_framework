## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Integration**

### **Leveraged Existing Systems**

All implementations leverage the existing DotMac Framework infrastructure:

- **Journey Orchestration Engine**: Extended `JourneyOrchestrator.ts` with new templates
- **Base Service Pattern**: All services extend `BaseService` from `dotmac_isp.shared`
- **Standard Exception Handling**: Uses `@standard_exception_handler` decorator
- **Pydantic v2 Models**: Modern validation and serialization
- **Database Integration**: Async SQLAlchemy with proper tenant isolation
- **API Standards**: Follows existing API patterns and response formats

### **Service Architecture**

```python
# Each service follows the same pattern:
class ServiceName(BaseService):
    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession, tenant_id: Optional[str] = None):
        super().__init__(db, tenant_id)
        self.journey_templates = self._initialize_journey_templates()
    
    @standard_exception_handler
    async def service_method(self, ...): 
        # Implementation with proper error handling
```

### **Journey Template Integration**

All new journey templates are designed to work seamlessly with the existing orchestrator:

```typescript
// Existing JourneyOrchestrator.ts can now use:
const enhancedTemplates = EnhancedJourneyTemplates.get_enhanced_isp_journey_templates();

// Start new journey types:
await orchestrator.startJourney('customer_success_monitoring', context);
await orchestrator.startJourney('commission_calculation', context);
await orchestrator.startJourney('lead_nurturing_automation', context);
```

## üöÄ **Implementation Guide**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# All services use existing dependencies
poetry install  # Already handles Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy, etc.
```

### **Step 2: Database Integration**
```python
# Add new tables to your Alembic migration
from .customer_success_journey import CustomerSuccessMetrics
from .reseller_performance_journey import ResellerPerformanceMetrics
from .commission_processing_automation import CommissionCalculation, PayoutRequest

# Tables are defined as SQLAlchemy models ready for migration
```

### **Step 3: Service Registration**
```python
# In your main application setup
from .journey_integration_template import register_enhanced_journey_templates

# Register new journey templates
registration_result = register_enhanced_journey_templates()
print(f"Registered {registration_result['registered_templates']} new journey templates")
```

### **Step 4: Configure Automation**
```python
# Set up automated triggers
journey_config = create_reseller_journey_config()

# Configure scheduled jobs (using your existing scheduler)
# Monthly commission calculation: 1st of each month at 9 AM
# Weekly customer health checks: Every Monday at 10 AM  
# Monthly performance reviews: 1st of each month at 9 AM
```

### **Step 5: API Integration**
```python
# Add endpoints to your existing routers
from .customer_success_journey import CustomerSuccessJourneyService
from .commission_processing_automation import CommissionProcessingService

# Services are ready to be used in FastAPI endpoints
@router.post("/customer-success/health-assessment")
async def assess_customer_health(customer_id: str, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    service = CustomerSuccessJourneyService(db, tenant_id)
    return await service.assess_customer_health(customer_id)
```

    'CUSTOMER_SUCCESS_MONITORING': { ... },
    'EXPANSION_OPPORTUNITY': { ... }, 
    'RENEWAL_MANAGEMENT': { ... },
    'RESELLER_PERFORMANCE_REVIEW': { ... },
    'TERRITORY_OPTIMIZATION': { ... },
    'TRAINING_OPTIMIZATION': { ... },
    'COMMISSION_CALCULATION': { ... },
    'PAYOUT_PROCESSING': { ... },
    'DISPUTE_RESOLUTION': { ... },
    'LEAD_NURTURING': { ... },
    'PAYMENT_PROCESSING': { ... }
}
```

### **Automated Triggers**
```python
# Scheduled triggers (cron-style)
SCHEDULED_TRIGGERS = [
    ('0 9 1 * *', 'commission_calculation'),      # Monthly commissions
    ('0 10 * * MON', 'customer_success_monitoring'), # Weekly health checks
    ('0 9 1 * *', 'reseller_performance_review'), # Monthly reviews
]

# Event-based triggers  
EVENT_TRIGGERS = [
    ('lead:behavior_recorded', 'lead_nurturing_automation'),
    ('commission:calculation_approved', 'payout_processing'),
    ('customer:health_score_declined', 'customer_success_monitoring'),
]
