## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow these guidelines for responsible disclosure:

### 📧 Contact Information
- **Email**: security@dotmac.app (preferred)
- **Alternative**: Create a private issue in GitHub

### 📋 Information to Include
When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, configurations
5. **Proof of Concept**: If available, provide PoC code or screenshots
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### ⏱️ Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### 🏆 Recognition
We appreciate responsible disclosure and will:
- Acknowledge your contribution in release notes (if desired)
- Provide credit in our security hall of fame
- Work with you on coordinated disclosure timing

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables and `.env` files (excluded from git)
2. **Validate input**: Always validate and sanitize user input
3. **Use HTTPS**: All production communications must use HTTPS
4. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
5. **Code review**: All security-sensitive code requires review

### For Operators
1. **Environment variables**: Use strong, unique values for all secrets
2. **Network security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
3. **Access control**: Implement principle of least privilege
4. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup security**: Encrypt backups and test restore procedures

## 🛠️ Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Multi-tenant isolation and data separation
- Session management with secure cookies

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS 1.2+ for all network communications
- Input validation and output encoding
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries

### Infrastructure Security
- Container security with non-root users
- Network isolation between services
- Secrets management with OpenBao/Vault integration
- Regular security updates and patching

### Monitoring & Logging
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security event monitoring
- Intrusion detection capabilities
- Regular security assessments

## 🔍 Vulnerability Categories

We're particularly interested in reports about:

### High Priority
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Insecure direct object references

### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure
- Business logic flaws
- Access control issues
- Session management problems
- Cryptographic weaknesses

### Low Priority
- Denial of service (non-amplification)
- Rate limiting bypass
- Information leakage
- Configuration issues

## ❌ Out of Scope

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:
- Issues in unsupported versions
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to user devices
- Denial of service attacks without amplification
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to the vendor)
- Self-XSS attacks
- Issues affecting users with administrative privileges acting maliciously

## 🚀 Security Development Lifecycle

### Pre-commit
- Static analysis security testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security linting and code quality checks

### Pre-deployment
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- Container security scanning
- Infrastructure security validation
- Penetration testing (for major releases)

### Post-deployment
- Continuous security monitoring
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures
- Security awareness training
