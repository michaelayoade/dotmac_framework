Archived workflows
==================

This folder contains GitHub Actions workflows that are not currently aligned
with the repository structure (e.g., they reference paths/services that do not
exist in this repo). They have been archived to reduce CI noise and confusion.

To restore a workflow, move it back into `.github/workflows/` after updating
its paths and commands to match the current repo layout.
