### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

The DotMac Framework implements multiple security measures:

#### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit, Semgrep for security linting
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety, pip-audit, OSV-Scanner
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog prevents credential leaks
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-aware review

#### Infrastructure Security
- **SARIF Integration**: Security findings in GitHub Security tab
- **Automated Scanning**: Daily vulnerability checks
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated security patches via Dependabot
- **Supply Chain**: SBOM generation and integrity checks

#### Development Security
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security checks before code commits
- **CI/CD Security**: Comprehensive security pipeline
- **Container Security**: Docker image scanning (when applicable)
- **License Compliance**: GPL/AGPL license detection and blocking

### üèÜ Security Best Practices

When contributing to the DotMac Framework:

#### For Developers
- Use `secrets.compare_digest()` for sensitive comparisons
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Log security events appropriately (without logging secrets)

#### For Deployment
- Use environment variables for configuration secrets
- Enable TLS/SSL for all communications
- Implement proper session management
- Use strong, unique passwords and API keys
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### üö® Security Incidents

In case of a confirmed security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Assess and contain the threat
2. **Communication**: Notify affected users within 24 hours
3. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes as quickly as possible
4. **Documentation**: Create incident report and lessons learned
5. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent recurrence
