# Step 2: Stop application traffic
kubectl scale deployment customer-portal --replicas=0

# Step 3: Restore from backup
kubectl exec -it postgres-primary-0 -- psql -f /backups/latest-backup.sql

# Step 4: Verify data integrity
kubectl exec -it postgres-primary-0 -- psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;"

# Step 5: Resume traffic gradually
kubectl scale deployment customer-portal --replicas=1
# Monitor and scale up if stable
kubectl scale deployment customer-portal --replicas=3
```

#### Application Recovery

```bash
# Step 1: Switch to maintenance mode
kubectl apply -f k8s/maintenance-mode.yaml

# Step 2: Deploy known good version
helm rollback customer-portal 1

# Step 3: Run health checks
curl -f https://api.dotmac.com/health

# Step 4: Exit maintenance mode
kubectl delete -f k8s/maintenance-mode.yaml
```

#### Infrastructure Recovery

```bash
# Step 1: Assess infrastructure state
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# Step 2: Restore from Infrastructure as Code
cd terraform/
terraform plan -out=recovery.plan
terraform apply recovery.plan

# Step 3: Redeploy applications
cd ../helm/
helm upgrade --install customer-portal ./customer-portal

# Step 4: Verify all services
kubectl get services
curl -f https://portal.dotmac.com/health
```

## üîê Security Incident Response

### Data Breach Response

```yaml
Immediate Actions (0-1 hour): 1. Isolate affected systems
  2. Preserve evidence
  3. Assess breach scope
  4. Notify security team
  5. Engage legal counsel

Short-term Actions (1-24 hours): 1. Contain the breach
  2. Assess data exposure
  3. Begin forensic investigation
  4. Prepare customer communications
  5. Notify relevant authorities (if required)

Long-term Actions (1-30 days): 1. Complete forensic analysis
  2. Implement remediation measures
  3. Customer notification and support
  4. Regulatory compliance
  5. Post-incident review
```

### Security Containment Procedures

```bash
# Step 1: Network isolation
kubectl network-policy deny-all-ingress customer-portal

# Step 2: User session invalidation
redis-cli FLUSHDB  # Clear all sessions

# Step 3: Certificate rotation
kubectl create secret tls new-cert --cert=new.crt --key=new.key
kubectl patch ingress customer-portal --patch='{"spec":{"tls":[{"secretName":"new-cert"}]}}'

# Step 4: Application lockdown
kubectl set env deployment/customer-portal MAINTENANCE_MODE=true

# Step 5: Audit trail collection
kubectl logs -l app=customer-portal --since=24h > incident-logs.txt
```
