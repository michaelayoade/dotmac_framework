# DotMac Design System

Welcome to the comprehensive design system for the DotMac ISP platform. This system provides a unified set of components, patterns, and guidelines to ensure consistency across all portal experiences.

## Design Principles

### 1. Consistency
Maintain visual and functional consistency across all ISP management portals (Admin, Customer, Reseller, Technician).

### 2. Accessibility
Every component meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards with full keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### 3. Performance
Optimized for real-time ISP operations with minimal bundle sizes and fast rendering.

### 4. Scalability
Built to support multi-tenant architecture with thousands of customers and complex network hierarchies.

### 5. Mobile-First
Responsive design with special consideration for field technicians using mobile devices.

## Portal-Specific Guidelines

### Admin Portal
- **Purpose**: Network management, customer administration, system configuration
- **Users**: ISP administrators, network engineers, support managers

### Customer Portal
- **Purpose**: Self-service account management, billing, support requests
- **Users**: ISP customers of all technical levels
- **Key Features**: Usage dashboards, payment processing, service requests
