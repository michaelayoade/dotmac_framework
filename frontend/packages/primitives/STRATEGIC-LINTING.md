# Strategic Linting Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a strategic approach to handling framework-level linting issues using reusable architectural patterns.

## Configuration

- **Project Type**: nextjs
- **Complexity Management**: Enabled
- **Governance**: Strict

## Scripts

- `pnpm lint:strategic` - Run strategic linting with framework-aware rules
- `pnpm lint:complexity` - Analyze component complexity
- `pnpm lint:report` - Generate detailed lint report
- `pnpm governance:check` - Validate governance compliance

## Architecture Patterns

1. **Framework-Aware Configuration**: ESLint rules that understand framework conventions
2. **Component Complexity Strategy**: Systematic approach to managing complex components
3. **Governance System**: Automated monitoring and reporting
4. **Migration Strategy**: Gradual improvement approach for legacy code

## Governance Thresholds

- **Simple Components**: {
  "maxLines": 100,
  "maxComplexity": 15,
  "maxParams": 5,
  "maxDepth": 4
  }
- **Complex Components**: Strategic exceptions documented in .complexity-governance.json

## Next Steps

1. Review complexity-report.json regularly
2. Update component classification as needed
3. Implement recommended refactoring
4. Monitor performance impact

## Support

This strategic implementation can be adapted for other projects by:

1. Updating PROJECT_CONFIG in scripts/implement-strategic-linting.js
2. Modifying .complexity-governance.json thresholds
3. Customizing .eslintrc.framework.js overrides
