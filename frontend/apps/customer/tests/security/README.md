# Security Penetration Testing Framework

This framework provides comprehensive security testing for the Customer Portal, validating all security fixes implemented to address the identified vulnerabilities.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Authentication Security
- ✅ Authentication bypass prevention
- ✅ Server-side rate limiting validation (client-side removed)
- ✅ Session fixation attack prevention
- ✅ Token validation and expiration handling

### 2. XSS Prevention
- ✅ Reflected XSS in all input fields
- ✅ CSP header validation and script injection blocking
- ✅ User input sanitization in error messages
- ✅ DOM-based XSS prevention

### 3. CSRF Protection
- ✅ CSRF token requirement for state-changing requests
- ✅ Cross-origin request blocking
- ✅ SameSite cookie validation

### 4. Injection Attack Prevention
- ✅ SQL injection attempt blocking
- ✅ Path traversal attack prevention
- ✅ Command injection prevention

### 5. Information Disclosure Prevention
- ✅ Sensitive information exposure in errors
- ✅ Debug information leakage
- ✅ HTTP header sanitization
- ✅ Stack trace exposure prevention

### 6. Session Security
- ✅ Secure session management (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- ✅ Concurrent session handling
- ✅ Session timeout validation

### 7. Business Logic Security
- ✅ Privilege escalation prevention
- ✅ Portal type access validation
- ✅ Role-based access control

### 8. Security Configuration
- ✅ HTTPS configuration validation
- ✅ Security header verification
- ✅ Attack pattern blocking

### 9. Data Protection
- ✅ Sensitive data logging prevention
- ✅ PII data masking
- ✅ Data transmission security

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all security penetration tests
npm run test:security

# Run specific security test suites
npx playwright test tests/security/security-penetration.test.ts

# Generate security test report
npx playwright test tests/security/ --reporter=html
```

## Test Environment Configuration

The tests use the following configuration:

```typescript
const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  rateLimiting: {
    maxRequests: 10,
    timeWindow: 60000,
    testRequests: 15
  }
}
```

## Security Fixes Validated

This test suite specifically validates the security fixes implemented:

### 1. Removed Client-Side Rate Limiting
- ✅ Confirms no client-side rate limiting UI components
- ✅ Validates server-side rate limiting responses
- ✅ Tests proper error handling for 429 responses

### 2. Error Boundaries Instead of Hard Redirects
- ✅ Authentication failures show error UI instead of redirecting
- ✅ API errors display graceful error boundaries
- ✅ User can recover from errors without losing context

### 3. Eliminated Mock Data Fallbacks
- ✅ APIs fail fast without exposing fallback data
- ✅ No development data exposed in production
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing data

### 4. Platform Integration
- ✅ Uses @dotmac/headless platform components
- ✅ Consistent error handling patterns
- ✅ Platform security header inheritance

## Expected Results

All tests should pass, confirming that:

1. **Authentication vulnerabilities are fixed**: No bypass possible, proper error boundaries
2. **Rate limiting is server-side only**: No client-side rate limiting components remain
3. **XSS is prevented**: Proper input sanitization and CSP headers
4. **CSRF protection is active**: Tokens required for state changes
5. **Information disclosure is minimized**: No sensitive data in error messages
6. **Session security is enforced**: HttpOnly, secure cookies
7. **Business logic is protected**: Proper role validation and access control

## Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Run tests in production-like environment**: Same security headers and configuration
2. **Test with real attack payloads**: Use actual XSS, SQLi, and other attack vectors
3. **Validate error responses**: Ensure no sensitive information leakage
4. **Check network traffic**: Verify security headers and token handling
5. **Test edge cases**: Malformed requests, concurrent sessions, timeout scenarios

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to your pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run Security Penetration Tests
  run: |
    npm run test:security
    npx playwright test tests/security/ --reporter=json --output-file=security-results.json
    
- name: Upload Security Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: security-test-results
    path: security-results.json
```

## Compliance Validation

This framework helps validate compliance with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Tests for common web vulnerabilities
- **GDPR**: PII data protection and masking
- **SOX**: Access control and audit trails
- **HIPAA**: Data encryption and secure transmission (where applicable)

## Reporting Security Issues

If any tests fail:

1. Review the specific test failure details
2. Check the implementation against the expected security controls
3. Verify the fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom
4. Re-run tests after fixes to ensure no regressions

## Continuous Security Monitoring

These tests should be run:

- ✅ **On every commit**: Basic security regression tests
- ✅ **Before deployment**: Full penetration test suite
- ✅ **Weekly**: Complete security validation
- ✅ **After security updates**: Comprehensive re-validation
