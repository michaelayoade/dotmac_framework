AI-First Chaos Engineering Resilience Tests
==========================================

This module implements chaos engineering tests to validate system resilience
under failure conditions. These tests ensure the Management Platform maintains
business continuity even when components fail or degrade.

Chaos Scenarios Tested:
- Service degradation and partial failures
- Network partitions and communication failures
- Resource exhaustion and capacity limits
- Third-party service outages
- Database connection failures
- Kubernetes orchestration disruptions
