### 4. Performance Monitoring and Metrics Export
**File**: `dotmac_billing/core/metrics.py`

- **Prometheus-compatible metrics** export
- **Business metrics tracking**: invoices, payments, dunning actions
- **System metrics**: database operations, API requests, gateway calls
- **Resource monitoring**: active accounts, pending invoices
- **Metrics middleware** for automatic API request tracking

**Metrics Categories**:
- Counters: Request counts, payment totals, error rates
- Gauges: Active accounts, pending invoices, overdue amounts
- Histograms: Response times, payment amounts
- Timers: Operation durations

### 5. Complete Notification Service Integration
**File**: `dotmac_billing/services/notifications.py`

- **Multi-channel notifications**: Email, SMS, Webhook, Push
- **Template engine** with Jinja2 for dynamic content
- **Provider architecture**: SMTP, Twilio, Platform webhooks
- **Default templates** for all billing scenarios
- **Priority-based delivery** with async processing

**Notification Types**:
- Invoice created/sent
- Payment success/failure
- Dunning reminders/escalations
- Account suspension/reactivation

### 6. Enhanced Database Migration Management
**Files**: 
- `alembic.ini` - Alembic configuration
- `migrations/env.py` - Migration environment
- `migrations/script.py.mako` - Migration template
- `dotmac_billing/core/migrations.py` - Migration manager

**Features**:
- **Tenant-safe migrations** with validation
- **Platform-coordinated deployments** with backup support
- **Schema validation** before and after migrations
- **Migration status tracking** and rollback capabilities
- **Multi-environment support** with configuration overrides

## ðŸ”§ Integration Points

### Event System Integration
```python
# Platform receives billing events
from dotmac_billing.core.events import get_event_manager

event_manager = get_event_manager()
await event_manager.emit_payment_succeeded(
    tenant_id="tenant-123",
    payment_data={"amount": "99.99", "currency": "USD"}
)
```

### Metrics Collection
```python
# Automatic metrics collection
from dotmac_billing.core.metrics import get_billing_metrics

metrics = get_billing_metrics()
metrics.record_payment_processed(
    tenant_id="tenant-123",
    amount=99.99,
    currency="USD",
    gateway="stripe",
    success=True
)
```

### Notification Sending
```python
# Send notifications
from dotmac_billing.services.notifications import get_notification_service

notification_service = get_notification_service()
await notification_service.send_invoice_notification(
    tenant_id="tenant-123",
    recipient="customer@example.com",
    invoice_data=invoice_data
)
```

### Migration Management
```python
# Platform-coordinated migrations
from dotmac_billing.core.migrations import get_migration_manager

migration_manager = get_migration_manager()
status = migration_manager.check_migration_status()

if status["needs_upgrade"]:
    success = migration_manager.tenant_safe_migration()
```
