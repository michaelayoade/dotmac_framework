# DotMac Platform Testing Strategy

**Comprehensive testing strategy aligned with business vision and AI-first development**

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Business-Critical Focus
Our testing strategy prioritizes **business outcomes over code coverage**, focusing on:
1. **Revenue Protection** - Billing, payments, subscriptions must never fail
2. **Customer Trust** - Service delivery, uptime, data integrity
3. **Scalability** - Multi-tenant isolation, performance under load
4. **Security** - Data protection, access control, compliance

## 🏗️ Testing Architecture by Platform

### ISP Framework Testing (Per-Tenant)
**Focus**: Core ISP operations, customer experience, network management

#### Revenue-Critical Tests (🚨 NEVER FAIL)
```python
@pytest.mark.revenue_critical
@pytest.mark.property_based
def test_billing_calculations_never_negative():
    """Property: Bills must never be negative regardless of input"""
    
@pytest.mark.revenue_critical  
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_complete_customer_billing_workflow():
    """Behavior: Customer can be billed end-to-end successfully"""

@pytest.mark.revenue_critical
@pytest.mark.contract
def test_payment_processor_integration():
    """Contract: Payment processing APIs work as expected"""
```

#### Customer Experience Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.customer_journey
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_customer_onboarding_workflow():
    """Complete customer journey from signup to first bill"""

@pytest.mark.customer_journey
@pytest.mark.property_based
def test_service_provisioning_edge_cases():
    """Property-based tests for service provisioning"""
```

#### Network Operations Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.network_monitoring
@pytest.mark.contract
def test_snmp_device_contracts():
    """Network device communication contracts"""

@pytest.mark.network_monitoring
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_network_outage_detection():
    """Network monitoring behavior in outage scenarios"""
```

### Management Platform Testing (SaaS Orchestrator)
**Focus**: Multi-tenant isolation, plugin licensing, deployment orchestration

#### Multi-Tenant Isolation (🔒 SECURITY CRITICAL)
```python
@pytest.mark.tenant_isolation
@pytest.mark.property_based
def test_tenant_data_isolation():
    """Property: No tenant can access another tenant's data"""

@pytest.mark.tenant_isolation
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_tenant_deployment_isolation():
    """Behavior: Tenant deployments are completely isolated"""
```

#### Plugin Licensing & Revenue (💰 REVENUE CRITICAL)
```python
@pytest.mark.revenue_critical
@pytest.mark.property_based 
def test_usage_based_billing_calculations():
    """Property: Usage billing calculations are always accurate"""

@pytest.mark.revenue_critical
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_plugin_licensing_workflow():
    """Complete plugin licensing and billing workflow"""
```

#### Container Orchestration (🚀 RELIABILITY CRITICAL)
```python
@pytest.mark.deployment_orchestration
@pytest.mark.contract
def test_kubernetes_deployment_contracts():
    """Kubernetes API contracts for tenant deployment"""

@pytest.mark.deployment_orchestration
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_tenant_scaling_behavior():
    """Auto-scaling behavior under different load patterns"""
```

### Cross-Platform Integration Testing
**Focus**: ISP Framework ↔ Management Platform communication

#### Service Integration Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.contract
def test_cross_platform_api_contracts():
    """API contracts between Management Platform and ISP Framework"""

@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.behavior
def test_tenant_provisioning_workflow():
    """Complete workflow: tenant creation → ISP deployment → billing"""
```

## 📊 Testing Strategy by Test Type

### 1. Property-Based Testing (40% of effort)
**Goal**: AI-generated edge cases for business logic

#### Implementation
```bash
# ISP Framework
make test-property-based    # Runs Hypothesis-based tests

# Management Platform  
make test-property-saas     # SaaS-specific property tests

# Example commands
pytest -m property_based --hypothesis-show-statistics
```

#### Key Areas
- **Billing Calculations**: Generate thousands of billing scenarios
- **Multi-Tenant Logic**: Test tenant isolation with random data
- **Network Management**: Test SNMP operations with device variations
- **Plugin Licensing**: Test usage tracking accuracy

### 2. Behavior Testing (30% of effort) 
**Goal**: Validate business outcomes and workflows

#### Implementation
```python
# Example: Complete customer journey
@pytest.mark.behavior
@pytest.mark.customer_journey
def test_residential_customer_lifecycle():
    """Test complete residential customer lifecycle"""
    # 1. Customer signs up
    customer = create_customer(customer_type="residential")
    
    # 2. Service is provisioned  
    service = provision_internet_service(customer.id, plan="basic")
    
    # 3. Usage is tracked
    record_usage(service.id, data_gb=150)
    
    # 4. Bill is generated
    bill = generate_monthly_bill(customer.id)
    
    # 5. Payment is processed
    payment = process_payment(bill.id, amount=bill.total)
    
    # Verify complete workflow succeeded
    assert payment.status == "completed"
    assert customer.account_status == "active"
```

#### Key Workflows
- **Customer Onboarding**: Signup → Service → First Bill
- **ISP Management**: Device → Monitor → Alert → Resolution
- **SaaS Operations**: Tenant → Deploy → Scale → Bill → Support
- **Reseller Channel**: Partner → Commission → Payout

### 3. Contract Testing (15% of effort)
**Goal**: API and service contract validation

#### Implementation
```bash
# Contract testing with Pact or similar
make test-contracts-all

# API schema validation
pytest -m contract --tb=short
```

#### Key Contracts
- **Payment Processors**: Stripe, PayPal integration contracts
- **Network Devices**: SNMP, device API contracts  
- **Cross-Platform**: Management Platform ↔ ISP Framework
- **External Services**: Email, SMS, storage providers

### 4. Manual Testing (5% of effort)
**Goal**: Critical path validation and user experience

#### Critical Manual Tests
- **Payment Flow**: End-to-end payment processing
- **Tenant Onboarding**: Complete ISP customer onboarding
- **Network Monitoring**: Real network device integration
- **Portal Usability**: Customer, admin, reseller portal UX

### 5. Legacy Unit Testing (10% of effort)
**Goal**: Critical business logic only

#### Focus Areas
- **Complex Algorithms**: Billing calculations, rate limiting
- **Security Functions**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization, schema validation
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling, boundary conditions
