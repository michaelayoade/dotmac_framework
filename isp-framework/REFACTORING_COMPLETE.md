## üîç Key Technical Patterns Implemented

### 1. Strategy Pattern Architecture
```python
# Before: Complex if-elif chains (High Complexity)
if condition_type == "equals":
    return field_value == expected_value
elif condition_type == "greater_than":
    return field_value > expected_value
elif condition_type == "contains":
    return expected_value in str(field_value)
# ... 10+ more conditions (Complexity: 14)

# After: Strategy pattern (Low Complexity)  
strategy = self.strategies.get(condition_type)
return strategy.evaluate(field_value, expected_value)  # Complexity: 3
```

### 2. Factory Pattern Integration
```python
# Clean factory methods for all systems
def create_lead_scoring_engine() -> LeadScoringEngine
def create_condition_engine() -> ConditionEvaluationEngine  
def create_schedule_engine() -> ScheduleCalculationEngine
def create_vault_auth_engine() -> VaultAuthenticationEngine
```

### 3. Template Method Pattern
```python
# Base retry executor with Template Method
class RetryExecutor(ABC):
    def execute_with_retry(self, operation, *args, **kwargs):
        # Template method with common retry logic
        for attempt in range(self.max_attempts):
            if self.should_retry(attempt, last_exception):
                continue
        # Specific strategies implement should_retry()
```
