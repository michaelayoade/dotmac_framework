RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. 🔒 Critical: Fix all security vulnerabilities before deployment. Use environment variables for secrets and implement proper access controls.
2. 🔄 Refactor high-complexity functions using Strategy Pattern or decomposition. Target functions with complexity > 10 for immediate refactoring.
3. 🧪 Increase test coverage by adding unit tests for uncovered code paths. Focus on critical business logic and error handling scenarios.
4. ⚠️ Address 7 critical issues immediately. These issues block production deployment.
