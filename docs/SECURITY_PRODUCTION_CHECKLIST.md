## üö® Security Incident Response

### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Assess and Contain**
   ```bash
   # Isolate affected services
   kubectl scale deployment dotmac-platform --replicas=0 -n dotmac-prod
   
   # Block malicious IPs at firewall level
   iptables -I INPUT -s MALICIOUS_IP -j DROP
   ```

2. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Security team: security@dotmac.com
   - Platform team: platform-eng@dotmac.com
   - Management: incidents@dotmac.com

### Investigation (15-60 minutes)

1. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Collect logs
   kubectl logs deployment/dotmac-platform -n dotmac-prod --since=2h > incident-logs.txt
   
   # Database audit logs
   kubectl exec -it postgresql-0 -n dotmac-prod -- \
     psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours';"
   ```

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Review application logs for anomalies
   - Check OpenBao audit logs
   - Analyze network traffic patterns
   - Review recent deployments and changes

### Recovery (1-4 hours)

1. **Implement Fix**
   - Apply security patches
   - Rotate compromised credentials
   - Update firewall rules
   - Redeploy affected services

2. **Verification**
   - Run security verification script
   - Test all critical functions
   - Monitor for continued suspicious activity

### Post-Incident (24-48 hours)

1. **Documentation**
   - Complete incident report
   - Update security procedures
   - Share lessons learned
   - Plan preventive measures

2. **Improvements**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting
   - Implement additional security controls
   - Update incident response procedures
   - Schedule security training
