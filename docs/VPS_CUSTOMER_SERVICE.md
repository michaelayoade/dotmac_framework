# VPS Customer Service Implementation

## Overview

The DotMac Framework now supports a **customer-managed VPS model** where customers provide their own server infrastructure while DotMac provides the software, installation, and ongoing support.

## Architecture

### Business Model
- **Customers provide**: VPS hardware meeting specified requirements
- **DotMac provides**: Software installation, configuration, monitoring, support
- **Revenue streams**: Setup fees ($500-$2000) + monthly support fees ($200-$800)

### Service Tiers
- **Basic**: Email support, business hours
- **Premium**: Phone + email, extended hours  
- **Enterprise**: Dedicated support, 24/7

## API Endpoints

### VPS Customer Management
```
POST /api/v1/vps-customers/requirements
GET  /api/v1/vps-customers/
POST /api/v1/vps-customers/
GET  /api/v1/vps-customers/{customer_id}/status
POST /api/v1/vps-customers/{customer_id}/retry-deployment
GET  /api/v1/vps-customers/{customer_id}/setup-instructions
```

### Key Features
- **Automated VPS requirements calculation** based on plan and expected usage
- **SSH-based remote deployment** using existing scripts
- **Real-time deployment status** tracking with progress indicators
- **Comprehensive validation** before deployment starts
- **Health monitoring** and support ticket integration

## VPS Requirements by Plan

### Starter Plan
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores
- **RAM**: 4-8 GB  
- **Storage**: 50-100 GB SSD
- **Network**: 100+ Mbps
- **Cost**: $20-40/month hosting + $500 setup + $200/month support

### Professional Plan  
- **CPU**: 4-8 cores
- **RAM**: 8-16 GB
- **Storage**: 100-250 GB SSD  
- **Network**: 500+ Mbps
- **Cost**: $50-100/month hosting + $1000 setup + $500/month support

### Enterprise Plan
- **CPU**: 8-16 cores
- **RAM**: 16-32 GB
- **Storage**: 200-500 GB SSD
- **Network**: 1+ Gbps  
- **Cost**: $100-200/month hosting + $2000 setup + $800/month support

## Deployment Workflow

### 1. Customer Onboarding
```bash
# Customer submits VPS details via API
POST /api/v1/vps-customers/
{
  "company_name": "Acme ISP",
  "subdomain": "acme-isp", 
  "vps_ip": "1.2.3.4",
  "ssh_key": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3...",
  "plan": "professional",
  "expected_customers": 1000
}
```

### 2. Automated Validation
```bash
# Comprehensive VPS validation
./scripts/validate-vps-deployment.py 1.2.3.4 --ssh-key=/path/to/key

# Checks:
✅ SSH connectivity
✅ System requirements (CPU, RAM, disk)
✅ Network connectivity 
✅ OS compatibility
⚠️ Docker installation (installed during deployment)
```

### 3. Remote Deployment
```bash  
# Automated deployment via SSH
./scripts/vps-customer-setup.sh setup acme-isp \
  --plan=professional \
  --ip=1.2.3.4 \
  --ssh-key=/path/to/key \
  --domain=acme-isp.com

# Deployment steps:
1. Validate connectivity
2. Check requirements  
3. Install Docker & dependencies
4. Deploy ISP Framework containers
5. Configure monitoring
6. Set up SSL certificates
7. Run health checks
```

### 4. Customer Handover
- ISP Framework accessible at `https://acme-isp.com`
- Admin credentials provided
- Monitoring dashboard configured
- Support portal access granted

## Support & Monitoring

### Health Monitoring
```python
# Automated health checks
- SSH connectivity tests
- HTTP endpoint monitoring (/health)
- Container status verification  
- Resource usage monitoring
- SSL certificate expiration alerts
```

### Support Ticket System
- Integrated ticket management for VPS customers
- Automatic escalation based on support tier
- Customer communication tracking
- SLA monitoring and credits

### Remote Support Capabilities
- SSH access for troubleshooting
- Log analysis and debugging
- Performance optimization
- Security updates and patches
- Backup verification and recovery

## Scripts & Tools

### VPS Customer Setup
```bash
./scripts/vps-customer-setup.sh setup <customer-id> [options]
./scripts/vps-customer-setup.sh validate <ip> <port>
./scripts/vps-customer-setup.sh requirements <plan>
./scripts/vps-customer-setup.sh health-check <customer-id>
```

### VPS Validation  
```bash  
./scripts/validate-vps-deployment.py <vps-ip> [options]
# Generates detailed validation report with recommendations
```

### Existing Integration
- Uses `scripts/deploy-tenant.sh` for ISP Framework deployment
- Uses `scripts/setup_monitoring.sh` for monitoring stack
- Integrates with existing SSH automation in `packages/dotmac-network-automation/`

## Database Models

### VPSCustomer
- Customer identification and contact info
- VPS connection details (IP, SSH credentials)  
- Plan and support tier
- Deployment status and timestamps
- Health check results

### VPSDeploymentEvent
- Detailed deployment event logging
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Error handling and retry logic
- Correlation IDs for troubleshooting

### VPSSupportTicket

- Priority and category tracking
- Assignment and resolution workflow
- Customer satisfaction tracking

## Security

### SSH Security
- Key-based authentication preferred
- Connection timeout and retry limits
- Command logging and audit trails
- Secure credential storage (encrypted)

### Customer Isolation
- Each customer gets dedicated containers
- Separate databases and Redis instances  
- Network isolation between customers
- Encrypted communication channels

### Access Control
